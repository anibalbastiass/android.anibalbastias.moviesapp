## Movies App Code Challenge

The goal of this application is get Movie data from TheMovie DB API for show the "Now Playing" in a
horizontal list and "Popular" endless vertical list. Also, pressing any item, you can see the
details of the movie.

This project is being maintained to match current industry standards.

# Motivation

In my previous job I supported, coached and guided many junior consultants to carry out quality Android Code challenges. This is why I was inspired by one in particular and took the opportunity to catch up with Jetpack Compose and the other Jetpack Libraries to improve my skills in Android Development.
Also, I took advantage of applying some knowledge (from previous jobs) of good practices, design patterns, clean architectures, testing, modularization and git submodules.

And lastly, create a Compose component library using Atomic Design, to maintain a structural and elegant design pattern.

# Architecture

* This project was developed using CLEAN Architecture and MVVM (Model View ViewModel) with some
  approaches from MVI (Model View Intent).
* The architecture contains the following features:
    * data:
        * remote: Using Retrofit (REST API) and OkHttp (Security and interceptors)
            * Now Playing Movies: Just consuming REST API without caching.
            * Popular: Consuming REST API using pagination with cache. Also, using Paging library
              with synchronization with Retrofit and Room DB
            * Repository for link to the domain layer
        * local: Using Room DB
            * Logic for create the RoomDB Instance, Entities and Daos.
            * Repository for link to the domain layer

    * domain: Intermediate layer between data and presentation, for have the business logic using
      agnostic use cases for connect to the ViewModels.

    * presentation: This contains the Ui Models (Only needed for the UI) using mappers, and the
      ViewModels

    * ui: Using Coil library for load images smoothly.
        * list: Contains 2 view components: Now Playing and Popular. Each one have own list for
          that.
        * detail: Simple fragment showing the detail data.

    * di: Means about using Dependency Injection using Dagger Hilt, separating the scopes for any
      layer and the ViewModel.

# Testing

This project have 3 kind of tests:

* Unit Tests: Using JUnit 4 and Mockito for check the business logic for ViewModels, 
repositories, models.

* Instrumentation Tests: Using MockWebServer for check the response of the REST API.

* UI Tests: Using Espresso for check the navigation.

# Extra functionalities

* Swipe Refresh Layout in the list
* ic_launcher for Movies logo
* Extra security layer for sensitive data
* Certification Pinning
* Favorite movies
* Swipe to add favorite
* Search movies
* Recent searches
* Expandable/Collapsable Toolbar in detail screen
* YouTube expandable screen + VieModel lifecycle handling

```
* Splash Screen API from Jetpack

# Approaches
## Both approaches are using the same architecture, with different
Ui frameworks

* `feature/xml-approach`: Using ViewBinding with XML Custom Views and LiveData.
* `feature/compose-approach`: Using Jetpack Compose with SharedFlow
